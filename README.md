# Memofante 2.0

A application for helping you learn japanese words.

This is a GUI/Flutter rewrite of the [rust version](https://github.com/coffeeispower/memofante). Now with a GUI, I plan to add many more features to memofante that are impossible in a TUI application but only time will tell how this will go.

## How does it work?

This is supposed to be used in conjunction with 10ten japanese reader browser extension, so you can hover over words in the browser to see the definition.

Memofante works with the concept of discovered words, when you find a new word on the internet that you had to use 10ten japanese reader because you didn't know it, you can copy it to memofante and then review the words later using spaced repetition.
